# leaflet-challenge2

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
First I visualized an earthquake dataset and completed the following steps:
1. Get my dataset and choose a dataset to visualize.
2. When I clicked a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), I was given a JSON representation of that data.
3. I used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
4. I then Imported and visualized the data by using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
